    <h2 class="description title">What Is Korean Fried Chicken?</h2>
    <p class="description para"> Korean fried chicken is one of the most popular delivery food in Korea. It is often drenched in some kind of sauce (we are going to use <em>gochujang</em> sauce this time).</p>

    <h2 class="steps title">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the chicken in a bowl. Add the buttermilk, salt, pepper and garlic salt. Mix together, cover and place in the fridge to marinade for at least 1 hour (up to over night).</li>
        <br />
        <li>Preheat the oven to a low heat (to keep cooked chicken warm). Heat a large pan of vegetable oil (or preheat your deep fat fryer) until hot (you can test by dropping a small cube of bread in there, if it rises immediately to the top and starts to bubble rapidly, it’s hot enough). You’ll need at least 1 litre (4 cup) of oil.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Mix together the crispy coating ingredients in a small bowl.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Take the chicken out of the fridge. Lift a piece from the buttermilk and allow the excess to drip off. Dredge the chicken in the crispy coating mixture – ensuring it’s fully covered. Place on a tray and repeat until all of the chicken is coated.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Once the oil is hot enough, add in 5 or 6 of the chicken tenders. You can add more or less depending on the size of your pan, just be sure not to overcrowd the chicken.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Cook for 3-5 minutes until golden brown and cooked in the middle. You can check this by cutting open a piece of chicken, if it’s no longer pink in the middle, it’s cooked.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Place on a tray in the oven to keep warm whilst you cook the rest of the chicken. **If you want to ensure the chicken stays extra crispy whilst in the oven, see my 'Top Tips for Success' section in the post.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Meanwhile make the sauce. Place the gochujang, honey, sugar, soy sauce, garlic, ginger, vegetable oil and sesame oil in a saucepan and stir together.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Bring to the boil, then simmer for 5 minutes until thickened.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Pour over the crispy chicken and carefully toss together, then top with the spring onions, chilli flakes and sesame seeds before serving.</li>
        <br />
        <li><strong>Enjoy!</strong></li>
