    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 Pounds of Boneless Rib Eye Steak</li>
        <li>1/2 Small Pear, Peeled and Coarsely Grated</li>
        <li>1/4 Cup Reduced Sodium Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons of Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons of Toasted Sesame Oil</li>
        <li>3 Cloves of Garlic, Minced</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon of Freshly Grated Ginger</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon of Gochujang</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons of Vegetable Oil, Divided</li>
        <li>2 Green Onions, Thinly Sliced</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wrap steak in plastic wrap, and place in the freezer for 30 minutes. Unwrap and slice across the grain into 1/4-inch thick slices.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine pear, soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil, garlic, ginger and gochujang. In a gallon size Ziploc bag, combine soy sauce mixture and steak; marinate for at least 2 hours to overnight, turning the bag occasionally.</li> 
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a cast iron grill pan over medium-high heat.* Working in batches, add steak to the grill pan in a single layer and cook, flipping once, until charred and cooked through, about 2-3 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and steak.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately, garnished with green onions and sesame seeds, if desired.</li>
        <li><strong>Enjoy!</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p><em>*If you do not have a cast iron grill pan, you can also use a large cast iron skillet.</em></p>
